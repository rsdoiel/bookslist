These scripts were tested with Perl 5.16 on Mac OS X 10.10.  You will need to have the Perl JSON module installed or available
to your Perl installation.

```
    cpan JSON
```

Your deployment can be tested with the following command

```
    perl bookslist-test.pl
```

You should see output looking something like

```
    someuser@somemachine.edu$ perl bookslist-test.pl
    Testing BooksList.pm
    Success!
```

If you don't see the "Success!" line then something went wrong. Sorry.
